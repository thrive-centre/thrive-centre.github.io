## Overview

This is a cross-disciplinary and collaborative project between the THRIVE centre at the University of West London and the School of Pharmacy at University College London (UCL), and the UCL Centre for Nerve Engineering. The project aims to investigate the fabrication of 3D printed collagen-based scaffolds for the treatment of peripheral nerve injury (PNI). 

Current treatments for PNI often involve harvesting nerve tissue from another part of the patient's body and grafting it to the injured site. However, there is a critical need for less invasive and more effective solutions. Tissue engineering offers a promising approach, with the ultimate goal of replacing damaged neural cells. Pioneering work at the UCL Centre for Nerve Engineering has resulted in the development of Engineered Neural Tissue (EngNT), incorporating living neural cells within a collagen hydrogel matrix. This approach holds significant promise for nerve regeneration. However, a key challenge remains: fabricating EngNT with precise cell patterning within a three-dimensional structure is crucial for effective regeneration. This is precisely the aim of this project. 

We hypothesise that these implants will act as targeted tissue nodes, effectively integrating therapeutic cells and/or drugs into damaged tissues and enhancing treatment efficacy for nerve impairments. To achieve this, the project will leverage: Combined pharmaceutical and chemical expertise including chemical synthesis, 3D printing and biomaterial development. Biological testing may involve in vitro assays including live cell imaging and confocal microscopy, with the opportunity for using preclinical models to test translationally relevant designs.

## Objectives

- Fabricate EngNT with precise cell alignment and 3D structure using advanced printing methods  
- Develop and optimise biomaterials to support long-term neural viability and integration  
- Explore delivery of therapeutic cells and drugs within the scaffold to enhance regeneration  
- Conduct biological testing including live cell imaging and in vitro assays  
- Evaluate implant performance in translational preclinical models  

## Scientific Vision

We hypothesise that these **3D nerve tissue implants** will function as targeted repair nodes, enhancing cellular integration and delivering therapeutic agents directly to the injury site. This approach has the potential to transform regenerative strategies for nerve damage and pave the way for more effective, minimally invasive interventions.

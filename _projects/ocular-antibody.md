## Overview

Ocular inflammation, a significant contributor to vision loss, is increasingly being targeted by new classes of protein-based medicines. The current focus in research is to enhance both the functionality and stability of these therapeutic agents.

Our work in this area has led to the development of monospecific antibody-based mimetics. These mimetics are designed to act like traditional IgG antibodies, exhibiting similar solution size and binding affinity, offering a promising approach to modulate inflammatory pathways.

A particular area of interest is exploring the advantages of bispecific IgG mimetics for inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. Unlike conventional antibodies, the mimetic we are developing is Fc-free. This is a crucial design choice, as the Fc fragment in traditional antibodies can sometimes trigger immune-related effector functions that might inadvertently drive, rather than inhibit, inflammation.

This project is a collaborative effort with the Institute of Ophthalmology. Our shared goal is to create a stable and Fc-free bispecific antibody-based mimetic that offers superior efficacy compared to current mono-specific antibodies in managing ocular inflammation.


## Objectives

- Design and express **monospecific and bispecific antibody mimetics**  
- Optimise molecular stability, solubility, and ocular tissue penetration  
- Evaluate efficacy in **inflammatory and fibrotic eye disease models**  
- Compare Fc-free constructs with traditional IgG antibodies for immune safety  
- Translate lead mimetics toward preclinical development  

## Why Bispecific & Fc-Free?

- **Bispecific mimetics** allow dual targeting of key inflammatory mediators  
- **Fc-free design** avoids Fc receptor-mediated effects that may exacerbate inflammation  
- Mimetic format may enable **better delivery, lower cost, and improved control** of activity  

## Collaboration

This project is a partnership between:

- The **THRIVE Centre** at University of West London  
- The **Institute of Ophthalmology**, University College London  

Together, we are advancing the next generation of precision biotherapeutics for eye diseases.

## Scientific Platform

- **Protein Engineering**: Design of compact, modular mimetics with antibody-like affinity  
- **Bioassays**: Functional validation using ocular inflammation cell and cytokine models  
- **Comparative Testing**: Benchmarking against monospecific antibodies and Fc-containing formats

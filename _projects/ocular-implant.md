## Overview

Retinal degenerative diseases are a leading cause of vision loss worldwide. Tissue engineering offers new therapeutic avenues through the development of **3D scaffolds**—biological structures that support retinal cell growth and enable localised delivery of cells, genes, and drugs.

This project focuses on **in-situ polymerisable collagen (IPC)**, a novel scaffold material that polymerises without toxic crosslinkers and avoids common issues with conventional collagen matrices. These properties make IPC highly promising for ophthalmic applications, particularly in **retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)** regeneration.

## Aims

The key innovation lies in combining **AI modelling** with **bioprinting and freeze-drying techniques** to optimise the scaffold design process. Instead of relying on trial-and-error experimentation, we use machine learning to:

- Predict printability, mechanical strength, and porosity of IPC scaffolds  
- Optimise freeze-drying and printing parameters for target tissue integration  
- Model the relationship between cell concentration, material composition, and construct quality  
- Accelerate scaffold customisation for patient-specific applications  

## Significance

Scaffolds fabricated through this AI-aided framework aim to:
- Enable minimally invasive ocular implantation  
- Improve scaffold reproducibility and reduce immunogenic response  
- Shorten development timelines in regenerative ophthalmology  

This work advances precision biomaterial design for vision science and sets a precedent for integrating **AI in scaffold fabrication workflows**.

## Collaborators

This is an in-house collaborative initiative at the **THRIVE Centre**, led by:

- The **Biotherapeutics Team**, specialising in collagen engineering and regenerative pharmacology  
- The **AI & Imaging Team**, focusing on machine learning for optimisation and predictive modelling  

## Technology Stack

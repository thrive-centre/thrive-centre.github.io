## Overview

Asthma affects over 300 million people worldwide, with a significant proportion suffering from **treatment-resistant severe asthma**. While type 2 (T2) inflammation-driven asthma often responds to corticosteroids and monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-5, IL-4R, and IgE, patients with **non-T2 or T2-low asthma** show poor response to existing biologics.

This project addresses the **urgent unmet need** to develop biologic therapies for non-T2 asthma, particularly in **late-onset, steroid-resistant patients**.

## Objectives

- Engineer a novel **bispecific antibody** that targets key non-T2 inflammatory pathways  
- Evaluate pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of the molecule  
- Develop and test **pulmonary delivery formats**—nebulised or dry powder  
- Optimise local bioavailability in inflamed lung tissue  
- Assess efficacy in relevant preclinical models of asthma  

## Innovation

Unlike currently approved biologics which are administered **parenterally**, this project focuses on **inhaled delivery**—an attractive, non-invasive alternative that enables:

- Direct targeting of the inflamed respiratory epithelium  
- Reduced systemic exposure and improved safety profile  
- Enhanced patient compliance and quality of life  

Recent studies (e.g. inhaled interferon beta-1a for COVID-19) demonstrate the feasibility and clinical potential of this delivery route for biologics.

## Collaborators

This is a joint initiative between:

- **THRIVE Centre**, University of West London  
- **School of Pharmacy**, University College London (Dr. Lam)

## Technical Approach

- **Antibody Engineering**: Bispecific construct design and stability assessment  
- **Formulation Development**: Nebulised solution and dry powder inhaler formats  
- **Delivery Testing**: Aerodynamic profiling, lung deposition simulations  
- **Efficacy Validation**: Biomarker response in cellular and in vivo models

## Overview

This multi-disciplinary research project introduces a novel strategy for ocular drug delivery through the development of 3D-printed, collagen-based micro-implants. Addressing limitations in current intravitreal injection methods—such as poor drug retention, frequent administration, and high clinical burden—the study integrates advanced biomaterials with bioprinting technology to create a minimally invasive, sustained-release therapeutic platform. The resulting constructs exhibit enhanced biomechanical stability, controlled degradation, and long-term biologic release, offering significant clinical promise for treating retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). 

## Objectives

- To engineer in situ polymerising collagen (IPC)-based hydrogels that are biocompatible, injectable, and suitable for 3D printing.
- To enhance the mechanical and degradation properties of IPC constructs through incorporation of methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA) and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA).
- To develop a reproducible 3D bioprinting protocol for precise intravitreal deposition of drug-loaded biomaterials within simulated ocular environments.
- To assess the influence of injection depth and volume on scaffold integrity, diffusion dynamics, and therapeutic delivery efficiency.

## Scientific Vision

This project envisions a paradigm shift in ophthalmic treatment through the fusion of biomaterial engineering, pharmaceutical science, and precision bioprinting. The scientific goal is to create intelligent, localized delivery systems that mimic physiological conditions and reduce the burden of frequent intravitreal injections. By leveraging the tunable properties of IPC-HAMA composites and CAD-driven 3D printing, the project lays the groundwork for personalised ocular implants capable of extended biologic release. The long-term vision extends to broader tissue-specific applications, positioning this work as a scalable platform for regenerative medicine and localized therapy delivery.

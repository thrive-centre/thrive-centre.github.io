## Overview

**Ocular inflammation** is a major cause of vision impairment and blindness, yet treatment options remain limited—especially in cases requiring long-term immune modulation. Biologic therapies, particularly antibody-based drugs, have shown promise, but their design must evolve to address key challenges of stability, tissue specificity, and unwanted immune responses.

This project focuses on **engineering antibody mimetics** that retain the high affinity and specificity of conventional IgGs while eliminating the **Fc fragment**, which can trigger undesired immune activation.

## Objectives

- Design and express **monospecific and bispecific antibody mimetics**  
- Optimise molecular stability, solubility, and ocular tissue penetration  
- Evaluate efficacy in **inflammatory and fibrotic eye disease models**  
- Compare Fc-free constructs with traditional IgG antibodies for immune safety  
- Translate lead mimetics toward preclinical development  

## Why Bispecific & Fc-Free?

- **Bispecific mimetics** allow dual targeting of key inflammatory mediators  
- **Fc-free design** avoids Fc receptor-mediated effects that may exacerbate inflammation  
- Mimetic format may enable **better delivery, lower cost, and improved control** of activity  

## Collaboration

This project is a partnership between:

- The **THRIVE Centre** at University of West London  
- The **Institute of Ophthalmology**, University College London  

Together, we are advancing the next generation of precision biotherapeutics for eye diseases.

## Scientific Platform

- **Protein Engineering**: Design of compact, modular mimetics with antibody-like affinity  
- **Bioassays**: Functional validation using ocular inflammation cell and cytokine models  
- **Comparative Testing**: Benchmarking against monospecific antibodies and Fc-containing formats

## Overview

Peripheral nerve injuries (PNI) can lead to long-term disability and currently rely on autografts—where healthy nerve tissue is harvested from elsewhere in the patient’s body. While clinically accepted, this method is invasive and often limited in efficacy. There is a pressing need for engineered alternatives that can enhance regeneration while reducing patient burden.

This project focuses on the design and fabrication of **3D printed collagen-based scaffolds** for the treatment of PNI. Specifically, it seeks to improve on the promising concept of **Engineered Neural Tissue (EngNT)**—a living construct developed at UCL that embeds aligned neural cells within a hydrogel matrix to guide nerve regrowth.

## Objectives

- Fabricate EngNT with precise cell alignment and 3D structure using advanced printing methods  
- Develop and optimise biomaterials to support long-term neural viability and integration  
- Explore delivery of therapeutic cells and drugs within the scaffold to enhance regeneration  
- Conduct biological testing including live cell imaging and in vitro assays  
- Evaluate implant performance in translational preclinical models  

## Scientific Vision

We hypothesise that these **3D nerve tissue implants** will function as targeted repair nodes, enhancing cellular integration and delivering therapeutic agents directly to the injury site. This approach has the potential to transform regenerative strategies for nerve damage and pave the way for more effective, minimally invasive interventions.

## Collaborators

This is a joint project between:

- **THRIVE Centre**, University of West London  
- **School of Pharmacy**, University College London (UCL)  
- **UCL Centre for Nerve Engineering**

## Expertise

The project combines:
- **Pharmaceutical sciences** (formulation, drug delivery)
- **Chemical engineering** (3D printing, synthesis)
- **Tissue engineering** (scaffold design, neural biology)
- **Bioimaging and preclinical validation** (confocal microscopy, in vitro models)

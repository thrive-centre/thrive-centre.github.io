# Research Projects

- [Inhaled Bispecific Antibody for Severe Asthma](/projects/inhaled/)

The project focuses on the development of Inhalable Bispecific Antibody Conjugates for Targeted Treatment of Asthma.

By integrating academic expertise with industrial innovation and support, the project is uniquely positioned to accelerate the translation of laboratory findings into clinically relevant therapies. Targeting multiple inflammatory pathways simultaneously, bispecific antibodies offer the potential to enhance treatment efficacy, address patient heterogeneity, and improve outcomes in severe and treatment-resistant asthma cases.

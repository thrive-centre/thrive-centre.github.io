## Overview

This multi-disciplinary project is intended to unravel new approaches for the AI-guided delivery of therapeutics to the brain tissue. Due to the impossibility of assessing the safety and efficacy of therapeutics for brain diseases (e.g., Alzheimerâ€™s disease) and trauma (e.g., accidental damages), there is an increasing need for the fabrication of brain tissue replicas that might emulate the physiological conditions within the human body. The engineer of a three-dimensional patient-specific brain construct is attractive, particularly for the possible assessment of functionality for delivery methodologies such as hydrogel-mediated injections. 

The main aim of this project is to address an urgent unmet clinical need to develop a novel 3D bioprinted brain construct to be used as platform for delivery testing due to AI-driven injections of click hydrogels loaded with therapeutics and the study of release, localisation, safety and efficacy.

## Objectives

- Design and fabricate anatomically and physiologically relevant brain tissue models using 3D bioprinting techniques.
- Incorporate key cellular and extracellular matrix components to mimic human brain microenvironment.
- Implement artificial intelligence algorithms to guide the delivery of click hydrogel-based therapeutics with spatial and temporal precision.
- Simulate and adapt injection strategies based on construct geometry and therapeutic distribution predictions.

## Collaboration & Impact

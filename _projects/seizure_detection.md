## Project Introduction

Although literature supports the notion that seizure detection algorithms require the ability to differentiate convulsive movements from common everyday activities, little has been done to achieve this.  

Seizure detection algorithms are commonly trained using sequential event prediction, where the measurements from past seizures are used to predict future occurrences. This approach has maintained a high false positive rate, as the detection process fails to account for movements that share the same spatial coordinates, often incorrectly classifying unrelated movements as a positive event.  

This project addresses the problem at an algorithmic level, developing a **deep learning model for accelerometer-based detection** that combines activity recognition with traditional seizure detection techniques.

## Dataset

- Data collected from **10 participants** (8 healthy, 2 with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy)  
- Wrist-worn tri-axial accelerometer and gyroscope, 25Hz, 48-hour recording  
- Movements included: brush teeth, jogging, walking, lie-down, sitting, upstairs, downstairs, make sandwich, sleeping, standing, watching TV, and seizure  
- 12 genuine seizures recorded, 34 simulated seizures guided by video recordings

## Feature Engineering and Pre-processing

- Each movement performed 5 times (â‰¤30s duration)  
- Data segmented into **10s fixed sequences** (200 samples each)  
- Segmented data used to train and test the model

## Network Architecture

This project used a **stacked LSTM neural network** for multi-class classification of fixed length time sequences.  

- **2 fully connected layers**  
- **2 stacked LSTM layers** (64 units each)  
- **ReLU activation** in hidden layers  
- **Softmax output** for multi-class classification

### Components
- **L2 Regularisation**: to prevent overfitting  
- **Loss Function**: cross-entropy with L2 regulariser  
- **Softmax Function**: probability distribution for classification  
- **Optimizer**: Adam, combining AdaGrad + RMSProp advantages

## Implementation

- Developed in **Python** with **TensorFlow 2.0** and **Keras**  
- Training conducted on **Google Colab**  
- **Train/Test Split**: 75% / 25%  
- **Learning Rate**: 0.0025  
- **L2 Loss**: 0.0015  
- **Epochs**: 50

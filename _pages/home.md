  - title: "New Eye Disease Treatments"
    description: "THRIVE is leading groundbreaking research to develop innovative biotherapeutic treatments for eye diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration. Led by Dr. Hanieh Khalili, this work focuses on creating bispecific antibodies that can reduce the frequency of injections required and pioneering 3D bioprinted retinal scaffolds to support damaged retinal cells. Collaborations with leading institutions and AI integration aim to accelerate drug development and improve patient outcomes, offering a promising solution for those suffering from chronic ocular conditions."

  - title: "AI-driven Heart Exam"
    description: "The UNITY project aims to transform cardiac imaging through AI. By creating a comprehensive, annotated biobank of echocardiographic images in collaboration with 11 NHS hospitals and the British Society of Echocardiography, the team is training AI algorithms to automate the analysis of heart images and videos. This initiative seeks to reduce human error, expedite clinical decision-making, and improve patient outcomes. Ultimately, UNITY aspires to integrate AI into routine clinical practice, setting a new standard for cardiac diagnostics."

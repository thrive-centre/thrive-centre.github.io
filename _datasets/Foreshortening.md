## Project Overview

We are training an AI to automatically detect and assess the degree of **foreshortening** in echocardiographic images, specifically in the **apical four-chamber (A4C)** view.  
To achieve this, we are **ranking images based on how foreshortened the heart appears**, from the most accurate view to the most foreshortened.

In many cases, the difference in foreshortening between two images may be minimal.  
When this occurs, the exact order of ranking is not critical.  
Just ensure that the images with significant differences in foreshortening are ranked accurately.

project_description:
  background: |
    Echocardiographic image quality plays a critical role in the reliability and accuracy of clinical interpretation. 
    However, image acquisition is highly operator-dependent, and suboptimal image quality can compromise diagnostic outcomes.  

    There is an unmet need for automated, real-time assessment tools that can evaluate and flag poor-quality echocardiographic images at the point of acquisition.
  research_questions:
    - "Can machine learning algorithms be trained to assess image quality in echocardiography automatically?"
    - "What visual features or quality metrics correlate most strongly with expert evaluations?"
    - "How can automated image quality scoring be integrated into clinical workflows for immediate feedback?"
  aims: 
    - "Develop an AI model capable of automatically assessing echocardiographic image quality."
  objectives:
    - title: "Define Metrics"
      steps:
        - "Define clinical and visual metrics for image quality with expert input."
    - title: "Dataset Development"
      steps:
        - "Develop a quality-annotated dataset based on expert reviews."
    - title: "Model Development"
      steps:
        - "Train and evaluate deep learning models to classify and score image quality."
    - title: "Integration"
      steps:
        - "Integrate quality assessment with downstream diagnostic pipelines."
  methodology:
    - "Collaborate with clinical experts to define grading criteria and label datasets."
    - "Apply convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention-based models to evaluate static and video-mode echo data."
    - "Benchmark model performance against expert-level scoring."
    - "Perform ablation studies to identify critical image features."

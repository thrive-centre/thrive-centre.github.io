## Proposed PhD Project

### Background

Heart disease is the **single biggest cause of death worldwide** and the number of people affected is growing every year.  

Heart disease often starts with symptoms or abnormalities in very brief episodes that come and go. This early period is usually the best time to start treatment to prevent more severe problems later on. Unfortunately, this is also the most difficult time to identify the problem because the symptoms or abnormalities have gone by the time the patient sees a doctor. The doctor cannot start the correct treatment until the condition is known.

For example, **atrial fibrillation** is a common heart condition that can cause strokes, which result in permanent disability. Atrial fibrillation starts off with very brief periods of rapid heartbeat that are not always noticed by the person having them. When that person sees a doctor, the heart rhythm has returned to normal so the doctor cannot diagnose the problem.  

There are many causes of rapid heartbeat, but only atrial fibrillation is treated with blood thinning medication to prevent strokes and save lives. In other conditions blood thinners are dangerous. In this common situation, doctors have two options but both are problematic:  

- Short-term skin-attached monitors (uncomfortable, visible, and limited to a few days).  
- Implantable devices (require surgery, carry infection/bleeding risks, and leave scars).  

---

### Aim

Our vision is to **develop smart clothing that uses artificial intelligence** to identify heart disease in people in their daily lives so that the correct treatment can be provided at the earliest possible time.

---

### Plan

We are developing **intelligent clothing** that can be worn comfortably in everyday life without anyone noticing and without any risky procedures.  

- The clothes have sensors to pick up abnormalities.  
- AI algorithms analyse the signals to identify heart problems.  
- Clothing can be worn during work, exercise, and sleep.  
- Long-term monitoring enables detection of **rare, short-lived events**.  

> Patients have consistently reported that they would prefer comfortable, discreet clothing to bulky, visible short-term monitors or implanted devices.

---

### Candidate Profile

We are seeking **highly motivated candidates** with a strong background in computer science, machine learning, or a related field.  

The ideal candidate should have:  

- Strong programming skills  
- Analytical and problem-solving abilities  
- Excellent communication and collaboration skills

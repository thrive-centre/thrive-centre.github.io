## Overview

Bispecific single-chain variable fragments (bs-scFvs) offer a versatile and compact format for **targeted biotherapeutics**, combining antigen specificity with manufacturability. This project pioneers a **recombinant–chemical hybrid approach** to efficiently produce and assemble bs-scFvs with defined architectures.

Leveraging the **flashBAC™ baculovirus system** and **site-specific ligation chemistry**, we create a modular, scalable workflow to design, express, and link antibody fragments.

## Objectives

- Express monospecific scFvs using **flashBAC™ baculovirus platform**  
- Develop **site-selective conjugation chemistry** for bs-scFv assembly  
- Retain antigen binding affinity and structural stability post-ligation  
- Enable rapid **prototyping of therapeutic formats**  
- Align the platform with **industry-standard workflows** for scale-up and translation  

## Why this matters

Traditional methods of generating bispecific antibodies are **labor-intensive, expensive, and poorly scalable**. Our integrated approach:

- Reduces development time and cost  
- Ensures precise control over bispecific structure and function  
- Allows plug-and-play flexibility for targeting multiple antigens  
- Facilitates **translation from research to manufacturing**  

## Collaboration & Impact

This project is co-developed with **industry partners** to ensure applicability in biotherapeutic manufacturing. It contributes to THRIVE’s broader mission to deliver **efficient, next-generation biologics** by bridging academic innovation with commercial readiness.

## Technical Framework

- **Protein Engineering**: Optimised scFv sequence design and construct validation  
- **Recombinant Expression**: High-yield scFv production using flashBAC™  
- **Chemical Ligation**: Controlled, bioorthogonal coupling to form bispecifics  
- **Characterisation**: Affinity, stability, and structural analysis of bs-scFvs

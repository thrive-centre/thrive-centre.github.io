# Biography
I am a PhD researcher in Computer Science at the University of West London, working under the supervision of Professor Massoud Zolgharni and Dr. Hanieh Khalili. My academic background is in Chemical Engineering; I completed my MSc at the University of Tehran, where my thesis focused on nanocarrier systems for targeted drug delivery. I earned my BSc from the Iran University of Science and Technology, with a concentration in process design and simulation. My research interests lie at the intersection of drug delivery systems, 3D bioprinting, AI in biomedical engineering, and biomaterials for cancer treatment. I aim to combine computational modeling with experimental approaches to develop innovative medical solutions. I have published a peer-reviewed paper and remain passionate about advancing research that bridges engineering and healthcare.

## Description  

We are building the **UK's largest and most diverse open-access biobank of echocardiographic images and annotations**.  
This collaborative effort fuels the development of AI algorithms that revolutionise cardiac care through improved image processing, acquisition, and interpretation.  

---

## Project Goals  

- Establish the largest UK open-access biobank of echocardiographic images.  
- Support AI research in **image processing, acquisition, and interpretation**.  
- Ensure diversity and quality in annotated datasets.  

---

## Methods  

**Active Learning**  
We select cases using active learning, prioritising uncertain or informative samples.  
This reduces annotation effort while maximising AI model improvement.

**Quality Ranking**  
For image quality projects, we apply the **Glicko-2 rating system**, originally designed for competitive games, to dynamically rank image quality from expert feedback.

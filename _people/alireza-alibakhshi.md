# Biography

Hey there, I’m Alireza Alibakhshi, a PhD student at the University of West London, where I’m on a mission to teach neural networks how to predict the quality index for heart echocardiography (because who doesn’t love telling a computer it’s smarter than them?). When I’m not deep-diving into rotation and foreshortening indexes in echo quality, you’ll find me obsessing over process-mining algorithms or debating whether stochastic optimization is truly random or not.

My toolbox is stacked: I code in Python (NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow), R, and Java; tinker with SQL Server, MySQL, and MongoDB; and even wrangle data in PowerBI and Arena Simulation. I also have teaching and research capabilities (I hope so.)

I maintain a GitHub lab of experimental code, and I’m always up for a collaboration or a chat about the next big breakthrough in Thrive’s quest to turn medical data into life-saving insights.

## Overview

PulseNote is a comprehensive web-based annotation platform designed for physiological time series signal analysis, with a primary focus on electrocardiogram (ECG) data labelling. The platform addresses the critical infrastructure gap in collaborative bio-signal annotation, enabling researchers and clinicians to efficiently create high-quality datasets for machine learning applications.

## Key Features

### Multi-Modal Signal Support
- Native support for multiple signal formats (WFDB, EDF, JSON, CSV)
- Flexible data import and export capabilities
- Compatible with standard physiological signal databases

### Collaborative Annotation
- Real-time multi-user collaboration
- Role-based access control (Administrator, Privileged, Normal)
- Conflict resolution mechanisms for concurrent annotations
- User authentication and project management

### Versatile Annotation Types
- **Point-based annotations**: Mark specific events or features
- **Interval selection**: Label temporal segments
- **Angle measurement**: Quantify morphological characteristics
- **Region-based annotations**: Define complex patterns

### Customizable Layouts
Seven specialized visualization layouts optimized for different annotation tasks:
- Standard multi-lead view
- Single-lead focused view
- Comparison view for multiple signals
- Feature extraction view
- And more...

### üîç Interactive Visualization
- Zoomable, scrollable signal plots using Plotly.js
- High-performance rendering for long-duration recordings
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Touch screen support (in development)

### AI Integration (in development)
- Display machine learning model predictions

project_description:
  background: |
    Medical ultrasound education, particularly in echocardiography, is traditionally hands-on and instructor-intensive. 
    However, limited access to real-time scanning experience and expert feedback constrains student learning and the standardization of training.

    Virtual Reality (VR) offers a powerful medium to simulate realistic echocardiographic scenarios, enhancing spatial awareness, probe handling skills, and interpretation in a controlled, repeatable environment.
  research_questions:
    - "How can immersive VR technologies be used to simulate realistic echocardiographic scanning environments?"
    - "What levels of realism and interactivity are necessary to foster clinical competence?"
    - "How can adaptive feedback and AI-driven assessment enhance learning outcomes?"
  aims:
    - "Design, develop, and evaluate a VR-based training platform for echocardiography education."
  objectives:
    - title: "Interactive VR Environment"
      steps:
        - "Develop a fully interactive VR training environment using real echocardiographic data."
    - title: "Probe & Anatomy Simulation"
      steps:
        - "Incorporate simulated probe manipulation and anatomical navigation."
    - title: "Feedback & Assessment"
      steps:
        - "Integrate real-time assessment and feedback mechanisms for learners."
    - title: "Evaluation"
      steps:
        - "Evaluate the effectiveness of the platform in postgraduate training courses."
  methodology:
    - "Co-design the platform with input from clinical educators and sonographers."
    - "Use Unity3D and haptic feedback integration for realism."
    - "Capture and map ultrasound probe trajectories to VR scenes."
    - "Conduct usability studies and learning outcome evaluations with MSc Medical Ultrasound (Echocardiography) students."
  clinical_partners:
    - "Imperial College London â€“ National Heart and Lung Institute"
    - "Affiliated NHS cardiology and echocardiography teams"
